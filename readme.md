# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts in Java

Java is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, which means it is built around the concept of objects and classes. OOP promotes code organization, reusability, and modeling real-world entities as objects. Here are some key OOP concepts in Java:

1. **Class**
   - A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.
   - It defines attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods) for objects of the class.

2. **Object**
   - An object is an instance of a class.
   - It has its own set of attribute values based on the class it was created from.

3. **Inheritance**
   - Inheritance allows a subclass to inherit attributes and methods from a superclass.
   - It supports the "is-a" relationship between classes.

4. **Polymorphism**
   - Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated uniformly.
   - Achieved through method overriding and interfaces.
   
   - **Method Overriding**: Subclasses can provide their own method implementation.
   - **Interfaces**: Define a common contract for classes to implement.

5. **Encapsulation**
   - Encapsulation bundles data and methods into a single unit (class).
   - It hides internal details and provides access control through access modifiers.

6. **Abstraction**
   - Abstraction simplifies complex reality by modeling classes based on essential properties.
   - Focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.

7. **Constructor**
   - A constructor initializes objects when they are created.
   - Has the same name as the class and can take parameters.

8. **Access Modifiers**
   - Control visibility and accessibility of class members.
   - Include `public`, `private`, `protected`, and package-private.

9. **Method Overloading**
   - Allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

10. **Static Keyword**
    - Defines class-level members (fields and methods).

11. **Final Keyword**
    - Indicates a class cannot be subclassed, a method cannot be overridden, or a variable is constant.

12. **Abstract Classes and Methods**
    - Abstract classes cannot be instantiated and serve as base classes.
    - Abstract methods have no implementation and must be provided by subclasses.

13. **Packages**
    - Organize classes into namespaces to avoid naming conflicts.

14. **Composition**
    - Allows a class to contain objects of other classes as attributes.

15. **Interface**
    - Defines a set of abstract methods for classes to implement.
    - Supports multiple inheritance of behavior.

These OOP concepts are fundamental to Java and form the basis for writing clean, maintainable, and extensible code.
